# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ryuukumar

I'm a student at DTU studying Computer Science! Been coding since I was 10, and I use this GitHub account for my hobbyist projects.

There isn't much fun stuff to see here since uploading my projects to GitHub isn't something I usually do, but I hope you find something interesting!

Some projects to look out for:

- My LMMS contributions
- COS, a simple OS kernel that I got too frustrated to continue working on
- DexGet, a MangaDex manga downloader with way too much effort spent on it
- Get-Waifu, a project entirely in PowerShell that I use myself on a daily basis for... well... stuff
- Whatever other tiny stuff I have on here
