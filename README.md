# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ryuukumar

I'm a student at DTU studying Computer Science (and ex-intern at Microsoft)! Been coding since I was 10, and I use this GitHub account for my hobbyist projects.

There isn't much fun stuff to see here since I rarely put stuff up on GitHub (and even more rarely actually make it public), but I hope you find something interesting!

Some projects to look out for:

- My LMMS contributions
- COS, a simple OS kernel that I regularly get too frustrated to continue working on (and then come back anyway)
- DexGet, a MangaDex manga downloader with way too much effort spent on it (RIP MangaDex)
- Get-Waifu, a project entirely in PowerShell that integrates with Telegram to get hi-res images off the internet
- Whatever other tiny stuff I have on here
